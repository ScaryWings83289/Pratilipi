A set of API endpoints made using Node.js, Express and MongoDB for Pratilipi Microservices architecture.

The application is composed of the following Features:

### Backend

- As of this moment I am using Mongodb for storing all data.
- I am using REST APIs convention for routing between different API endpoints.
- Only authenticated user can perform CRUD operations.

## Quick Start

Clone the repository and do following:

```bash
# Install dependencies for server
npm install

# Run the Express server
npm start or nodemon app.js

# Server runs on http://localhost:3000
```
